Jeeves is built by with with input from top mythic raiders, collectors, and community organizers to provide a epic experience for your discord community. Able to scale from a small friends & family guild to a large mega server with countless configurations Jeeves is perfect for almost everyone.


## History
Jeeves was born in early 2017 under the name `The Lazy Peon`. It was a pretty bad bot. Really Bad. It broke frequently was only in 1 server, but generated some amazing laughs. Not long after that `the Lazy Peon` was rebuilt from the ground up and given a new name `Jeeves`. Jeeves remained a core stable in our guilds discord for about a month when the decision was made to post it to Reddit just to see if anyone else cared to use it. 3 hours of watching the Reddit post get 2 up votes and no comments later we shrugged and moved on. Little did we know what was in store for us when we woke up.... 30+ comments and around 76 up votes. Quickly putting out fires and adding EU support in just under an hour Jeeves was quickly on over 100 servers. Sense then its been a race to add more and more features, fix bugs and bring Jeeves from a hobbiest level bot to a professionally written scalable application for use on thousands of servers.

## The 3.0 Update
Jeeves 3.0 is the big anniversary update of Jeeves, Release almost 1 year to the date after it went public it is a full recode of everything. Over 67,000 lines of code were rebuilt from the ground up. It has been in the works for over 4 months and represents a large step in what we believe Jeeves can become.

## The Future and Beyond
Jeeves is constantly being updated with new features. We have formed partnerships with various Fan Sites & Services like RaiderIO, TSM, WoWHead to bring new and exciting features into your guilds discord. We firmly believe that Discord is here to stay and is the community platform for Warcraft. Our goal is to keep making it better by bringing Warcraft ever closer to discord itself.
