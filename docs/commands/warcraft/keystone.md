# Keystone Command

Love to share your keystone(s) with your guild members? You can add your keystone(s) to your characters. This command works together with the `!character` command.

With multiple active high level characters you can use `!keystone <character> <dungeon> <level>`. With this you can easily track keystones within your guild.

By adding your characters to Jeeves, it is easier to keep track of which character has which keystone. You'll also see the item level of the characters!
